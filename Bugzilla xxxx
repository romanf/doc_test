## Incident Report

### Summary
An internal employee raised a question about the content of the EV juristictionStateOrProvinceName field. This question was reviewed by our product manager and he realized that we use the ISO 3166-2 code for this field instead of the full name of the State or Province as required by EV Guidelines chapter 9.2.4. The product manager then started the internal compliance incident process.
